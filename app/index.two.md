## More info

“Let's tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years –- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.” – President Barack Obama, January 27, 2010

Many graduates from college and professional programs start their careers overburdened with debt. The prospect of paying off their student loans is daunting and may even seem impossible. Thankfully the Obama-Biden Administration’s is pushing this agenda to make higher education more affordable and to help more Americans earn college degrees because in reality virtually all of the students who graduate college in 2014 will emerge with massive student loan debt. If you have federal student loan debt then President Obama’s student loan forgiveness program might be your best opportunity to save some serious money.

## What is this Act and what are the options?

If you are weighed down with student loan debt, you need to be aware of the New College Cost Reduction and Access Act which gives new hope for student loan reduction or forgiveness.
The Act is designed to increase purchasing power, strengthen economic recovery, and restore fairness in financing higher education in the United States through student loan forgiveness, caps on interest rates on Federal student loans, and refinancing opportunities for private borrowers, and for other purposes.
Depending on the type of loan you have, there are plans available that may eliminate a large portion or even all of your debt. Different careers have different requirements for loan forgiveness. Here are just a few options that may be available to you.
